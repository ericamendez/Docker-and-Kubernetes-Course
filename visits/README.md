# Docker Compose with Multiple Local Containers

### Things I Learned:
- How to use docker-compose and configure a `docker-compose.yml` file that will be parsed by the docker-compose CLI to start up multiple containers simultaneously, and do some basic docker commands that docker-compose automated to run more efficiently.
- How to connect two containers using docker-compose.
- Rebuilding containers using doccker-compose `docker-compose up --build` command.
- How to run containers in background using docker-compose `docker-compose up -d` command.
- Killing multiple containers using docker-compose `docker-compose down` command.
- How to automatically restart containers when they crash by specifying a restart policy in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
